# kmeans


The K-means clustering algorithm is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data. This can be used to confirm business assumptions about what types of groups exist or to identify unknown groups in complex data sets.

In the above code, kmeans clustering is implemented to understand how to find the mean of the different clusters
