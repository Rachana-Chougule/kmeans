# K-Means Clustering 

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm on a random scatter plot using only the NumPy library. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how K-Means clustering can be applied to group data points based on their similarity.

## Scatter Plot Generation

The scatter plot used in this project is randomly generated using the NumPy library. It consists of a set of 2-dimensional data points with no predefined labels or clusters. The goal of the K-Means algorithm is to identify and assign these data points to clusters based on their proximity to each other.

## K-Means Clustering Algorithm

The K-Means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to partition a given dataset into K clusters. It works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updating the centroids based on the new assignments. The algorithm converges when the assignments and centroids no longer change significantly.

## Implementation Details

In this project, we have implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm using only the NumPy library. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:

Data Generation: Random scatter plot data points are generated using NumPy arrays. The number of data points and their coordinates can be adjusted based on requirements.
Initialization: K cluster centroids are initialized randomly or using specific techniques, such as the K-Means++ initialization. Each centroid is represented as a coordinate in the feature space.
Assignment: For each data point, the nearest centroid is identified based on the Euclidean distance. The data point is then assigned to that cluster.
Update: After assigning all data points to clusters, the centroids are updated by calculating the mean of all the data points assigned to each cluster.
Iteration: Steps 3 and 4 are repeated iteratively until convergence. Convergence is achieved when the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
Visualization: The final clusters are visualized on a scatter plot, where each cluster is assigned a unique color for easy identification.
Usage

## To use this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that the NumPy library is installed. If not, install it using pip install numpy.
Open the provided script or notebook that contains the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
Adjust the parameters, such as the number of clusters (K) or the number of data points, to experiment with different settings.
Run the script or notebook to perform K-Means clustering on the random scatter plot.
Analyze the results and observe how the data points are grouped into clusters.

##Conclusion

This project demonstrates how the K-Means clustering algorithm can be implemented on a random scatter plot using only the NumPy library. The implementation provides a basic understanding of how K-Means clustering works and its ability to identify natural groupings within data.
